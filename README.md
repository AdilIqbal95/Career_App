JobbaHunt is a job search application built in full stack with react on the client, django REST framework API on the server and a postgreSQL datatbase. Users can create an account, search jobs on Reed API, save jobs, update progress of job applications. Interactions with the app allows the user to collect points that can be exchanged for rewards e.g. virtual coffees with CEOs, linkedIn connections, etc.

## Description 
The the aim of JobbaHunt is to improve the job searching process which can be long, stressful and demotivating. We hope the casual language, emojis, and rewards will brighten up the process and motivate users to continue job hunting.

5. Set up ticket system with estimated completion timeframes
6. Prepare for deployment! And deploy! Deploy daily to welcome new changes! 
5. Mob/pair programming to collaborate and we had an open call available all day  

## Changelog

## Bugs
- [x] issue with switch statement / nested switch routes not working. Solved with useRouteMatch
- [x] login/register path not rendering correctly. Solved with location.reload 
- [x] /register rendering login form. Solved by refactoring and creating new register page (but i think there could be an even better solution that requires less code lines) 
- [x] nav bar and side bar is protected from unauthed user, however main section content still shows upon logout. Solved with history.push to login and useState for style visibility change 
- [x] users and profile IDs not matching on back end
- [x] recursive functions error causing infinite requests to our django API. Solved by using useEffect 
- [x] nav bar moving the whole main container on hover
- [ ] users can add daily streak multiple times a day
